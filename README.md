👋 Hi everyone! Welcome to my GitHub
About Me

I’m Lucas, currently a student at Holberton School since February 2025. My first year is dedicated to mastering the fundamentals of computer science and software engineering: programming, algorithms, data structures, and system administration. This intensive curriculum gives me a strong and versatile technical foundation.
In the following two years (2026–2028), I plan to specialize in cybersecurity, a field that fascinates me for its constant evolution and its crucial role in protecting digital systems. I’m highly motivated to keep learning, take on new challenges, and build a career where I can make a real impact.
